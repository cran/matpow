Title: matrix powers
Version: 0.1.1
Description: A general framework for computing powers of matrices.  A
   key feature is the capability for users to write callback functions,
   called after each iteration, thus enabling customization for specific
   applications.  Diverse types of matrix classes/matrix multiplication
   are accommodated.  If the multiplication type computes in parallel,
   then the package computation is also parallel.
